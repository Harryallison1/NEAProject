        #if the form is invalid it returns the same registration template with the form object
        #which now contains the user's inputs and the associated validation errors.
        #The render function renders the template and passes the form with errors back to the user.



        #redirect to a template telling them that an account has not been created and pass the form errors a
        #or redirect to the register template again and say how they need to do a new password.

               # login(request, user)
                #return redirect('home')  # Redirect to a success page or home
    else:
        form = RegisterForm()

    return render(request, "accounts/register.html", {"form": form})     

#ur password canâ€™t be too similar to your other personal information.

#How the code works on this page: I have saved it on a word document called Register View
